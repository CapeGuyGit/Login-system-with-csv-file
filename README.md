# Login-system-with-csv-file

by using csv file i have created login system in python

csv = comma seprated values

this code is neatly organized and commented 

i have explained how the code works 

the whole code is written in python

this system is just like a normal bank system
just not as secured as the banks are

-_-

but, it asks for the name and pin, goes to the file and get every pin in the csv file
checks the pin with every pin

same with the name, if the name and pin match the data base
then it prints access granted

i know i could've used json file
but, csv is way easier than json and its easy to read, its just comma sepreted values

this file took 1 hour to make, hope this file helps out


note: just use this file on ur own risk, csv files are extremely heavy and may take the provided spaces in virtual env
